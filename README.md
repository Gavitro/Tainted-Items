## What is this?
My abandoned work on the "Tainted Items" Binding of Isaac mod. Essentially, it adds a "tainted" counterpart to certain vanilla items.

## Why is this open-source?
I have a habit of working obsessively on a personal project, then quickly losing steam and dropping my work like a rock. Normally when this happens, I keep the project to myself. But here, I think the general idea of "tainted items" is far too valuable to throw away, so I am presenting my work here in case others want to start where I left off.

## Are there leftover ideas from this which you want to share?
I have a design doc which I used to write down ideas for tainted items that I didn't end up implementing. I will not share this doc, but someone else associated with the project may be willing to if they want their vision of the mod to be continued, and I won't stop them.

## If I released a finished version of this, can I credit you?
I would appreciate it if you did, but I would understand if you saw me as a cowardly scumbag and decided I'm not worth crediting. Other people who helped me on this are listed on 'credits.txt'.
